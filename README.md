# Network Management Project - Zabbix Implementation

## Overview
This project was developed for the “Network Management” course at the Instituto Superior de Engenharia de Coimbra (ISEC). It explores the installation, configuration, and testing of the Zabbix monitoring tool in a simulated network environment.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Zabbix**: Network monitoring tool  
- **Ubuntu**: Virtual machine operating system  
- **VMWare Workstation**: Virtualization platform  
- **GNS3**: Network simulation tool  

## Project Highlights
- Virtual environment setup with Ubuntu on VMWare Workstation  
- Zabbix installation and database configuration  
- Simulated network topology using GNS3  
- Monitoring of CPU load and network traffic through Zabbix  
- Real-time data visualization and alert configuration  

## Conclusion
Zabbix is a powerful and scalable tool for network monitoring. Despite its initial complexity, its flexibility and robust feature set make it ideal for managing network infrastructure.
